# I3Helper

It extends some i3wm functionality. Currently there are 3 functions which i personalli use:
* Temporarily highlight the indicator border when changing the split direction
* Add command for switching to last used workspace
* Remap the pagedown and pageup keys to half-page scroll in all workspaces except one where i play games, ofc in real time (TODO: remap depending on window class because scroll speed differs from app to app)
